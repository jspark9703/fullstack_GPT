The building has glass doors that Winston Smith enters, and the hallway has a distinct smell of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. There is a large colored poster at one end of the hallway, depicting the face of a man in his forties with a black mustache. The flat that Winston lives in is on the seventh floor, and he usually has to climb the stairs since the lift is often not working. On each landing, there is a poster with the face of a man, and the caption beneath it reads \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.\" Inside the flat, there is a telescreen, an oblong metal plaque on the right-hand wall that cannot be completely shut off. The living-room of the flat has a unique layout, with the telescreen positioned unusually opposite the window instead of the end wall. There is also a shallow alcove in the room, possibly intended for bookshelves. By sitting in this alcove, Winston can stay out of sight from the telescreen, although he can still be heard. The room\\'s layout has inspired Winston to take a certain action, although the specific action is not mentioned in the given context.')"
