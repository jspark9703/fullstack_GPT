      "- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)\n",
      "- 1 cup tomato puree\n",
      "- 1/2 cup heavy cream\n",
      "- Salt to taste\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Heat the butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.\n",
